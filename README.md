# NEPTUNIC-TERMUX

NMscript is a simple script written in python that helps us access some nmap functionalities quickly and easily. The code for this is extremely simple and can be greatly improved. I upload it because it was one of my first projects and I am very fond of it (I will upload the same project with the nmap library)

# Nmap
Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free, open source tool for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. Network administrators use Nmap to identify which devices are running on their systems, discover hosts that are available and the services they offer, find open ports, and detect security risks. Nmap can be used to monitor individual hosts as well as extensive networks spanning hundreds of miles of devices and multitudes of subnets.

Although Nmap has evolved over the years and is extremely flexible, at its core it is a port scanning tool that collects information by sending raw packets to system ports. Listen to the responses and determine if the ports are open, closed, or filtered in some way by, for example, a firewall. Other terms used for port scanning include port discovery or enumeration
